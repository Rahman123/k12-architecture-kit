# Salesforce.org K12 Data Architecture

## Based on HEDA
While it may not seem like it at first, there is a large bit of overlap in the foundational needs of Higher Education and K12 with respect to technical architecture. Both have students, schedules, class periods, relationships with people, households, programs, etc.

We've leveraged much of the object model and logic that is already producing great results in the Higher Ed industry and added some extra functionality with respect to K12 user stories. In addition, we've aligned with the EdFi data standard.

This repository (as of this writing) contains purely the objects and fields necessary to align with the aforementioned EdFi data standard. Eventually, the logic to back up the K12 user stories will be added here as well.

## We Reserve the Right to Get Smarter
This architecture could change at anytime. Therefore make your decisions based on what is officially available today outside of this repository.
